# WebTest
Prior to the completion of my postgraduate study in Web Development, I fiddles around with a pure html, css, and javascript project. This was essentially a test wireframe, or mockup for what would have been a portfolio at the time. 

Since completing my postgraduate study I have been working on a more up to date alternative in the form of a Vue.js web application. However, this mock-up did provide me a means of familiarising myself with the Twitter Bootstrap Framework, and to develop more of an understanding of core web development concepts such as html, css, and Javascript.
